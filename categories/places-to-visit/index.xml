&lt;p>Reaching Mechuque is part of the experience. From Dalcahue, you can take a boat to Tenaún or Achao, and from there continue through the channels of the Chauques Islands. Some boats travel directly from Dalcahue to Mechuque, offering a scenic journey through quiet fjords and forested islands that seem frozen in time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
