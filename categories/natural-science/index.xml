&lt;p>The foundation of Chiloé lies in the ongoing convergence of the Nazca and South American plates along the Peru–Chile Trench. This subduction zone has caused crustal uplift and deformation throughout the region, generating the Coastal Cordillera—of which Chiloé represents the southern, insular continuation. The island’s basement rocks, primarily composed of metamorphic schists and granitic intrusions, date from the Paleozoic era and were later deformed and uplifted during the Andean orogeny.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
