Tectonic Origins The foundation of Chiloé lies in the ongoing convergence of the Nazca and South American plates along the Peru–Chile Trench. This subduction zone has caused crustal uplift and deformation throughout the region, generating the Coastal Cordillera—of which Chiloé represents the southern, insular continuation. The island’s basement rocks, primarily composed of metamorphic schists and granitic intrusions, date from the Paleozoic era and were later deformed and uplifted during the Andean orogeny.

Glaciers carved deep U-shaped valleys, fjords, and basins, leaving behind characteristic glacial landforms such as drumlins, moraines, and overdeepened troughs. When the ice retreated about 12,000 years ago, postglacial marine transgressions flooded these depressions, isolating Chiloé from the mainland and forming its intricate network of channels and inlets.</p><h2 id=postglacial-and-marine-processes>Postglacial and Marine Processes</h2><p>After deglaciation, isostatic rebound and sea-level fluctuations further modified the coastline. Coastal erosion, sedimentation, and tidal dynamics shaped Chiloé’s estuaries and wetlands, while rivers draining from the interior deposited sediments that built fertile lowlands along the eastern side of the island. The western coast, exposed to the open Pacific, is dominated by cliffs and marine terraces formed by wave action and uplift.</p><h2 id=modern-landscape>Modern Landscape</h2><p>Today, Chiloé’s geomorphology reflects this dynamic history: a mosaic of rolling hills, drowned valleys, and raised marine terraces, covered by temperate rainforests and peat bogs. Its landscape stands as a record of the interplay between tectonics, glaciation, and sea-level change — a living laboratory for understanding the evolution of Chile’s coastal cordillera and the legacy of the last glacial cycle.</p></div><div class=chips><a class=chip href=/categories/natural-science/>#natural-science</a></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>© 2025 Chiloé: science and places · Made with ❤️ from Chiloé</p></div></footer></body></html>
